## Basic Syntax

```python [0|1|2|3|5|7]
def add(x, y):
    y = y + 2
    return x + y

result = add(1, 2)          # 5

user_input = input("Enter your name")
```

<!-- Some notes -->
- Indentation standard is 4 spaces, but it can be any number of spaces as long as they are consistent
- The `input()` function will always return a string; need to convert variable type for calculations
