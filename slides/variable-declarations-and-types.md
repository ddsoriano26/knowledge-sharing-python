### Variable Declaration and Types

```python [0|2-3|4|5|6]
x = "Hello world!"              # str
x = 22                          # int
x = 3.14                        # float
x = 4 + 26j                     # complex
x = False                       # bool
x = None                        # NoneType
```

You **CAN** use a variable type as the name of a variable.
