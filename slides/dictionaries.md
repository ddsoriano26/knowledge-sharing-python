## Dictionaries

JSON-like objects, contain key-value pairs

```python [0|1-6|8-9]
employee = {
    "name": "Denise",
    "age": 18,
    "address": "Laguna",
    "companies": ["ADI", "HCL"]
}

employee["name"]                # Denise
employee["age"]                 # 18
```

Python's dictionary keys are not restricted to strings
